# Customer Attrition Prediction
### About the dataset
Verizonet, a telecommunications company based in California, has been operating for six years, providing phone and internet services to customers across more than a thousand cities and zip codes. Despite a highly skilled sales team successfully attracting new clients, the company faces a significant challenge: a high customer attrition rate. At the end of the last quarter, only 43% of newly acquired customers chose to continue their services, resulting in a decrease in the total customer base.
